#Project Description
## Business Goal — Analyze agent metrics to predict attrition, optimize training, and improve performance scoring for client reporting.
Key Features & Flow

## Raw Data — Agent performance logs, call outcomes, handle time, quality scores, HR data (tenure, shifts), surveys.

### Ingestion — Batch: ADF incremental loads (watermark pattern) from multiple sources.

### Processing — Databricks for medallion transformations, feature engineering (e.g., calls per shift, resolution rate), simple ML (logistic regression or Spark MLlib) for attrition risk.

### Storage — Delta Lake Gold layer for agent 360 views.

### Serving — Synapse Dedicated SQL Pool for fast reporting; Power BI for scorecards.

### Governance — Purview scanning + catalog, RBAC via Entra ID groups.

### Cost Control — Spot instances for ML training, query optimization, reserved capacity.

### CI/CD — Git-integrated DevOps pipelines, notebook versioning, MLflow for model tracking.

### Dashboard Highlights — Agent scorecard, attrition probability trends, top drivers (e.g., high AHT shifts), training ROI.
